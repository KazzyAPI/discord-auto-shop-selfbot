# Discord Auto-Shop Poster!

What this generally does is, help make posting your shop easier by using a selfbot. To keep things simple it just post a message on the given id's you have entered.

## Installation

Ensure you have node installed before continuing.

```bash
npm install
```

## Before starting open config.json and edit the following 
- **bottoken** | If you dont know what this is you shouldnt be here :P
- **channels** | The format is an array so ensure each new id is separated by a , and encase in "".
- **message** | Just what you wanna sell.
- **betweenSends** | Extremely important that you find an average time in which all your markets you are posting in have so you can ensure the message is sent. Usually markets will have a slowmode on.
- **afkstatus** | Will just tell people that message you that you are afk
- **embed** | Boolean value, set true to send as embed or false to not.
- **Rest are self explanatory**
